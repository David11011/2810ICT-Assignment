# 2810ICT/7810ICT 2022 Assignment

The assignment work for this course is a group-based (max 3 people) data analysis project that is split into 2 parts – design and implementation. There are several different datasets in this repository – you will need to choose 1 that your team will work on for both Part A and B. The overall goal for this assignment is to develop a simple data analysis and visualisation tool for a dataset. You will need to design and implement this tool, and it must provide a graphical user interface that will handle the analysis and visualisation of the data. Each dataset has a number of analysis and visualisation tasks that your interface must enable a user to perform. In addition to the listed tasks, you must come up with 1 additional analysis/visualisation/insight that your software provides (you will need to come up with an appropriate task based on the dataset you pick).
